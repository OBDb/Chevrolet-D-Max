    description: "The first-generation Chevrolet D-Max (in markets where Chevrolet badged this model) was essentially a rebadged Isuzu D-Max, a mid-size pickup truck developed by Isuzu but sold under various brands through GM's partnership with the Japanese manufacturer. Available in single cab, extended cab, and crew cab configurations, it was designed primarily for global markets outside North America. Powertrain options typically included 2.5L to 3.0L diesel engines and occasionally gasoline options depending on the market, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior was functional and durable rather than luxurious, reflecting its positioning as a work-oriented vehicle in many markets. This generation established the D-Max as a reliable, capable pickup in regions where compact and mid-size trucks were primary work vehicles rather than lifestyle products."

    description: "The second-generation D-Max featured more modern styling and improved refinement while maintaining its robust, work-oriented character. Still based on Isuzu engineering but sold as a Chevrolet in select markets, it continued to offer single cab, extended cab, and crew cab body styles. Diesel engines remained the primary powertrain option, with improved power, efficiency, and emissions control. The interior saw notable improvements in design and material quality, with more comfort and technology features, particularly in higher trim levels intended for dual-purpose work and family use. Safety equipment was enhanced throughout the production run, with features like stability control, hill descent control, and multiple airbags becoming available. This generation maintained the model's reputation for durability while adding refinement and features expected by evolving customer preferences."

  - name: "Third Generation"

    end_year: null
    description: "The current D-Max (where sold as a Chevrolet) represents a significant advancement in design, technology, and capability. Developed once again by Isuzu but with input from various badge-engineering partners, it features a more assertive exterior design with a larger grille, muscular fenders, and modern lighting elements. Powertrains continue to focus on diesel technology, typically centered around refined 1.9L and 3.0L turbodiesel engines with improved power delivery and efficiency. The interior has been thoroughly modernized with a more car-like design, improved materials, and significantly enhanced technology including larger touchscreens with smartphone integration and advanced driver assistance systems. Safety has become a major focus, with the latest models achieving impressive crash test ratings through multiple airbags, enhanced structural design, and active safety features. Where sold as a Chevrolet, the third-generation D-Max allows the brand to compete effectively in the global mid-size pickup segment with a modern, capable truck that balances work utility with passenger comfort and contemporary technology."
